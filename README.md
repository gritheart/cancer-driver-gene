Abnormal changes of driver genes are serious for human health and biomedical research. Identifying driver genes, exactly from enormous genes with mutations, promotes accurate diagnosis and treatment of cancer. A lot of works about uncovering driver genes have been developed over the past decades. By analyzing previous works, we find that computational methods are more efficient than traditional biological experiments when distinguishing driver genes from massive data. In this study, we summarize eight common computational algorithms only using somatic mutation data. We first group these methods into three categories according to mutation features they apply. Then, we conclude a general process of nominating candidate cancer driver genes. Finally, we evaluate three representative methods on ten kinds of cancer derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program and five Chinese projects from International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). In addition, we compare results of methods with various parameters. Evaluation is performed from four perspectives, including CGC, OG/TSG, Q-value and QQ-plot. To sum up, we present algorithms using somatic mutation data in order to offer a systematic view of vairous mutation features and lay the foundation of methods basd on integration of mutation information and other types of data.
